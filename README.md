this is the source code for my website. of which the main feature is a terminal that
will, at some point, be capable of running my prior 
Console applications in a mock terminal via asyncronous processes
which have their outputs streamed to the browser using signalR. 

obviously this is currently not a reality but it is being worked towards.

if you would like to fork this code you are more than welcome to utilise any part of the code and
refactor it to your own needs just as i have done with others projects to help me produce this.
